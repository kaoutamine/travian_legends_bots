TODOS and ideas :


There might be an issue because I use gid=16 which is hardcoded for the rally point.
At some point in the future, might be good to have a hashmap of building gid / id
Concept | What it is | Example
gid | Building type (fixed across all villages and servers) | gid=16 → Rally Point, gid=15 → Main Building, etc
id | Building position/slot (dynamic depending on where you built it in your village) | id=34 could be your Rally Point if you built it at slot 34
